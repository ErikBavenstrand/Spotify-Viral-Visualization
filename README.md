# [Spotify Viral Visualization (link)](https://bavenstrand.se/Spotify-Viral-Visualization/)

> This project originates from the course DH2321 Information Visualization at KTH Royal Institute of Technology as a group project but has since then been updated by myself.

Spotify Virality Visualizer is a visualization tool used to gain insight into modern music trends on a global scale. The data used is the top 50 songs for each week and country from Spotify's viral playlists from winter 2017 to winter 2020. A viral song is a song that has a high amount of social media shares, song plays, and other web exposure in a short period. The attributes visualized are aggregated by Spotify and consists of a song's core elements. 

The attributes used for the visualization tool are the following.

- **Danceability** describes how suitable a track is for dancing.
- **Energy** is a measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.
- **Speechiness** detects the presence of spoken words in a track.
- **Acousticness** is a confidence measure whether the track is acoustic or not.
- **Instrumentalness** measures whether a track contains no vocals.
- **Livness** measure the presence of an audience in the recording.
- **Valence** is a measure of musical positiveness conveyed by a track.
