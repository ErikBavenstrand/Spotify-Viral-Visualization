            <p>Viral 50 is an information visualization project by a group of KTH students
              that aims to visualize how viral music differs around the world as well as over time.
               The data used has partially been mined from spotifycharts.com and partially collected
               from Spotify's developer API. Spotifycharts is a website where the weekly viral 50 charts
               of countries around the world are available from the start of 2017. The Spotify developer
               API provides countless features and parameters that can be used for visualization, but
               especially interesting are the audio features of the tracks. It includes parameters like
               danceability, loudness, and acousticness.
            </p>
            <p>To eliminate time spent on developing a back end of our own and allow us to focus on
              the visualization part of the project, the data is stored statically in the code repository
              on GitHub. The website is hosted by GitHub pages and developed in vanilla javascript with the
              help of tools/libraries such as gulp, d3.js, SASS, MDL, and jQuery.

            <p>This project is part of the course 'Information Visualization' (DH2321) at KTH.
              The task of the project was to either choose an offering from a company/KTH employee
               or come up with an idea yourself for a visualization project. Seeing as the entire team had
               an interest in music and wanted to challenge ourselves by collecting and pre-processing the
               data on our own, we chose to go with the latter and create something based on data from Spotify. 
            </p>
            <p>After browsing previous visualization projects based on Spotify data, a brief exploration of the
              Spotify developer API, and some discussion within the group, we settled on analyzing the viral 50
              charts along with the audio analysis/audio features data provided by Spotify for individual tracks.
